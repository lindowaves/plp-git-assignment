1. Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
- git is a version control system that helps you track changes to your files over time. GitHub is a cloud-based platform where developers can store and manage their Git repositories. Version control provides a detailed history of changes and allows you to roll back in order to fix errors.

2. Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps, and what are some of the important decisions you must make during this process?
- In the upper corner of github.com, select +, then click New Repository.
- Type a short, memorable name for your repository.
- add a description of your repository. For example, "My first repository on GitHub."
- Select Initialize this repository with a README.
- Click Create repository.

3. Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
- The README file provides a detailed description of the project. It tells the reader what the project is about, which technologies were used, how to setup the enviroment, how to use it and how to troubleshoot. This allows people to collaborate effectiveley because the project is well documented.

4. Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
- A public repository is available for everyone on the internet but a private repository can only be viewed by people you grant access to. A public repository is useful for Open-source projects, sharing code for learning or demonstration, and showcasing personal projects. A private repository is ideal for projects involving sensitive information, intellectual property, or internal development.

5. Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?
- A commit is a record of changes to one or more files in your project.
- Commits allow you to track changes along a period of time.
- In order to create a new commit, go to your Terminal and go into the directory of your project. Type the command git -m commit message" and press Enter.

6. How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
- A branch is a contained area of your repository. It allows you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas separately without afecting other branches.
- You create a new branch by opening your terminal in your project and typing git branch branch_name.
- You then make whatever changes you wish.
- if you want to merge branches you need to go to the main branch and merge by typing git checkout main && git merge new_branch.

7. Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
- A pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch into another.
- A developer creates a pull request to request that their changes, which are typically in a separate branch, be merged into the main codebase.
- Other team members can then review the proposed changes, leave comments, and suggest modifications before the changes are integrated.
- This process promotes collaboration and ensures that code changes are reviewed and discussed before they are merged into the main codebase. 


8. Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?
- Forking is the process of creating your own copy of a project on github which you can make changes to. It doesn't affect the original project but it is an entirely new project.
- CLoning downloads a copy of a repository to your local machine.
- ub), while "cloning" downloads a copy of a repository to your local machine. Forking is used for collaborative development and contributing to open-source projects, while cloning is for local development and working with a repository.
